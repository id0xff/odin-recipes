# odin-recipes
This project is a plain HTML site.
It includes a main page with links to several additional pages containing different recipes.
By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated HTML skills such as:
– creating an HTML boilerplate;
– working with text;
– working with links and images.
And, of course, working with Git and GitHub.

The idea and all the recipes were taken from https://www.allrecipes.com/longform/best-brownies-review/
